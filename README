Gerrit Test Utils
=================

Tools for testing your Gerrit submit rules.
At the moment it only provides one tool: with_commit/2 which let's you create a temporary, Gerrit-like, environment with mocked data.


How to use this?
================

When you write your tests, wrap the test code in with_commit/2, like this:

    test(my_test_name) :-
        % This will add the label to gerrit:commit_label,
        % and remove it after the tes
        with_commit([label('Verified', -1, user(1))],
            % Just check that the label is really there
            gerrit:commit_label(label('Verified', -1), user(1))).


There are also examples from Gerrit manual with tests for them available in examples/.
